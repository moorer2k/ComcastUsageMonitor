# ComcastUsageMonitor
I have implemented most of the xfinity networks API for future/others use. Eventually I will create alerts and such, but for now it's pretty bare. Good to check your current network usage, and the history. As you can see, I've gone over my limit, which is what sparked the idea to create this tool.
